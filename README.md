# Project 1
## Predictive Analytics

Implemented Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, K-Means Clustering, PCA to explore Predictive Analytics on various datasets

CSE 487/587 Assignment 1:Predictive Analytics

The objective of this assignment is to get started with Predictive Analytics. The goals of the
assessment is to implement a predictive analytics algorithm from scratch and to create a
Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.

### PART - 1
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms
● Implement Supervised Learning algorithms K-NearestNeighbour and Random Forest
● Implement Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
● Implement K-Means Clustering
● Implement Evaluation measure Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Within cluster Sum of
squares

NOTE: The implementation should only use NumPy and Pandas as external libraries.

### PART - 2
Scikit-Learn Pipeline for Machine Learning
● Using the Scikit-learn library, implement supervised learning algorithms SVM, Logistic
Regression, Decision tree, KNN
● Using the Scikit-learn library create an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the
above-mentioned algorithm.
● Create visualization using Matplotlib library, of the confusion matrix for each of the 5
classifiers (including the ensemble).

### Dataset:
You are provided with data.csv along with this document. The data has 48 features and the last
column corresponds to the label. Use this to implement your algorithms. Your algorithms will be
evaluated on a private test set, and points will be allocated on the basis of the performance on
this test set.
